## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is a web application for individuals who are moving. Users will be able to log into this app and enter in information regarding what stage they are in the moving process. After they provide the app with that information, it will populate a checklist of items that they need to complete throughout the process. Users will also be able to upload any useful moving documents such as lien waiver, contracts, etc. allowing them to have all important documents in one location. 

I decided to create this app because I recently moved and given the distractions of everyday life I found myself forgetting to do basic tasks. The goal with this is to be able to provide individuals with a resource of helpful information to create a more seamless moving expereience.
